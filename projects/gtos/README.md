# Object Oriented Programming in 'C'
- C++-like programming in 'C' without the overhead
- We have to accept that there will be concessions and conventions
    - that are not enforced by the compiler
    - but we will use the compiler to check our data types where possible
    - and we want allow the IDE's hinting to help us

## OBJECTIVES
- Classes
- Calling with `obj->method(parms...)` - but without having to pass `obj` again
    - eg: NOT `obj->method(obj, parms...)`
- Minimum of "conventions"
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Functional 
    - `obj->foo()->bar()`

## SOLUTION
